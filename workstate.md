memory.issueIdentity = firefox.workspace-manager

## Status

phase = bootstrap
branch = dev

## Done

- Internal extension pages are now permanently excluded from DEEP actions.
- Full manager has an explicit Zavřít button.
- Settings panel open/closed state persists across manager refresh/reload.

- Group-level DEEP action added; it protects active, pinned and audible tabs.
- Settings panel added with lifecycle policy stored per exact hostname/subdomain, not per tab.
- Host policy modes: AUTO, KEEP, DEEP.

- Full-page manager added for large tab collections.
- Compact Unicode status indicators added: ● active, ✓ loaded, ○ deep/unloaded; extra flags use practical symbols.
- Popup can open/reuse the full manager tab.

- Bulk DEEP action added: discards all eligible inactive tabs while protecting active, pinned and audible tabs.

- Diagnostic popup added: windows, groups, tab state flags and manual DEEP discard.

- Repository initialized.
- `main` and `dev` branches created.
- Initial Manifest V3 extension skeleton added.
- Window/tab/tab-group snapshot prototype added.
- VS Code / web-ext development tooling started.
- Dedicated development Firefox profile chosen.

## Current decisions

- Develop on `dev`; keep `main` stable.
- Test in isolated Firefox profile, not production profile.
- Use AGENTS.md for durable project rules.
- Use this file for active state and remote/local handoff.
- Use ZLKL AI Memory context `firefox.workspace-manager` for shared long-term context.

## Next

1. Pull latest dev and verify full manager no longer disappears after DEEP actions.
2. Verify Nastavení stays open after refresh/re-render.
3. Verify Zavřít closes only the manager tab.
4. Verify DEEP ALL still discards normal inactive tabs but never moz-extension:// manager pages.
5. Connect saved hostname policies to automatic lifecycle behavior.
6. Add optional parent-domain/wildcard inheritance after exact-host behavior is validated.
7. Integrate generated extension icon into manifest/action assets.

## localCommand

status = done
owner = local-user
task = Pull latest dev and test DEEP ALL EXCEPT ACTIVE. Verify active, pinned and audible tabs stay loaded while other eligible tabs become discarded and remain in their groups.

## localResult

status = success
summary = DEEP ALL EXCEPT ACTIVE ověřeno v sandbox Firefoxu. Při aktivním nic.cz byly ostatní vhodné taby uvolněny z paměti; about:processes po akci ukazoval prakticky jen aktivní nic.cz, service worker YouTube a systémové Firefox procesy. Skupiny/taby zůstaly zachované.
