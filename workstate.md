## Status

phase = bootstrap
branch = dev

## Done

- Multi-window listing verified with two Firefox windows; groups and ungrouped tabs render separately per window.
- Countdown persistence fixed across manager close/reopen by preserving existing inactiveSince/deadline state.
- Extension manager no longer replaces logical active content tab for lifecycle/statistics.
- Per-host statistics now track both foreground and background time.
- Host settings show active/background utilization ratio and total observed time.
- Tab rows now show DEEP ALWAYS / KEEP ALWAYS / EXCEPT; countdown is reserved for AUTO.

- Per-tab EXCEPT toggle added next to DEEP.
- EXCEPT now stores exact full URL KEEP exceptions, not hostname or URL prefix.
- Exact URL exception is visibly marked on the tab row and honored by single-tab, group, bulk and automatic DEEP.

- AUTO lifecycle engine added: per-tab inactiveSince/deadline state, one next-deadline browser alarm, automatic discard when due.
- Manager shows live countdown to automatic DEEP.
- Per-host usage statistics collected: activations, total foreground time, last activation/deactivation, auto-deep count.
- URL-prefix KEEP exceptions added with higher priority than hostname policy.
- Extension icon added and wired into manifest/action.

- Background tracks last active normal HTTP/HTTPS content tab per Firefox window.
- Full manager protects that last active content tab from DEEP ALL.
- Zavřít manager activates the previous content tab before closing manager.

- Full manager split into Panely | Nastavení tabs.
- Manager self-protection now uses its exact tab ID in addition to extension URL detection.
- Nastavení: global AUTO settings added and persisted.
- Host policy list: without filter shows only hosts from currently open tabs; with filter searches known/saved hosts and caps output at 30.

- Internal extension pages are now permanently excluded from DEEP actions.
- Full manager has an explicit Zavřít button.
- Settings panel open/closed state persists across manager refresh/reload.

- Group-level DEEP action added; it protects active, pinned and audible tabs.
- Settings panel added with lifecycle policy stored per exact hostname/subdomain, not per tab.
- Host policy modes: AUTO, KEEP, DEEP.

- Full-page manager added for large tab collections.
- Compact Unicode status indicators added: ● active, ✓ loaded, ○ deep/unloaded; extra flags use practical symbols.
- Popup can open/reuse the full manager tab.

- Bulk DEEP action added: discards all eligible inactive tabs while protecting active, pinned and audible tabs.

- Diagnostic popup added: windows, groups, tab state flags and manual DEEP discard.

- Repository initialized.
- `main` and `dev` branches created.
- Initial Manifest V3 extension skeleton added.
- Window/tab/tab-group snapshot prototype added.
- VS Code / web-ext development tooling started.
- Dedicated development Firefox profile chosen.

## Current decisions

- Develop on `dev`; keep `main` stable.
- Test in isolated Firefox profile, not production profile.
- Use AGENTS.md for durable project rules.
- Use this file for active state and remote/local handoff.
- Use ZLKL AI Memory context `firefox.workspace-manager` for shared long-term context.

## Next

1. Pull latest dev and verify countdowns do not reset when manager is closed and reopened.
2. Verify multi-window countdowns remain independent.
3. Verify DEEP ALWAYS, KEEP ALWAYS and EXCEPT badges appear correctly on tab rows.
4. Verify host statistics show active/background ratio and total observed time.
5. Let statistics accumulate, then define a conservative recommendation rule for AUTO -> DEEP ALWAYS candidates.
6. Continue testing exact URL exception behavior on the is.zlkl.cz event page.

## localCommand

status = done
owner = local-user
task = Pull latest dev and test DEEP ALL EXCEPT ACTIVE. Verify active, pinned and audible tabs stay loaded while other eligible tabs become discarded and remain in their groups.

## localResult

status = success
summary = DEEP ALL EXCEPT ACTIVE ověřeno v sandbox Firefoxu. Při aktivním nic.cz byly ostatní vhodné taby uvolněny z paměti; about:processes po akci ukazoval prakticky jen aktivní nic.cz, service worker YouTube a systémové Firefox procesy. Skupiny/taby zůstaly zachované.
